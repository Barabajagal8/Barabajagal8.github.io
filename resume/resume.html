			<h2><i> Professional Meme Archivist/Bounty Hunter</i></h2>
			<p>
			For many years I have traveled the valleys and hills of this land, sifting through the soil, and searching the trees for only the dankest of memes. To add to my grand portfolio of exceptional skills, I have sought out the greatest leaders of both body and mind that this planet has to offer, that I may learn from their experiences.<br/><br/>    I have defeated the ghost of Albert Einstein at chess, and have beaten such titans of physical ferocity as Bjorn Hafthor and Stephen Hawking in advanced tests of strength. Furthermore, I have ridden to the moon itself on the sturdy back of a device of my own design and manufacture.

			<h4>Kingdom of Azerbaijan</h4>
			<h4>10-06-1983&mdash;12-05-2003</h4>
			<p>  In my time as the Grand Officiator of the Court of Azerbaijan, my duties were myriad. One morning could begin with a completely legal interrogation of a political dissident, and yet another could begin with a few rounds of golf, and then the deep frying of the King's customary camel hump, of which he was so fond of having for his midday victuals. <br/><br/> Additionally, it was my duty to officially deliver each child of my Great and Mighty Liege unto the world, a task which i did not relish, as his wives were many, and his vitality immeasurable. I was also in charge of filing his taxes. </p>
			<h3><span class="jobTitle">Bounty Hunter</span></h3>
			<h4><abbr title="Final Reckoning Services">FRS</abbr> Bounty Services</h4>
			<h4>13-05-2003&mdash;present</h4>
			<p> Currently I spend my days as a wildly unsuccessful bounty hunter. Bounties in this day and age are rather hard to come by, and, as I have no money for equipment, I find myself completely unable to contend with more affluent firms. </p>
